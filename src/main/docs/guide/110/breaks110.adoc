The following changes could potentially be considered to be breaking changes, however the likelihood of any negative impact is low.

* link:{api}/io/micronaut/session/http/HttpSessionConfiguration.html[HttpSessionConfiguration] default value for `cookiePath` is `/`. The change was necessary for cookies to function normally.

* The link:{api}/io/micronaut/security/token/jwt/render/AccessRefreshToken.html[AccessRefreshToken] API has been changed to  include `tokenType` and `expiresIn`. This change was necessary to comply with the token response link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.4.html[RFC 6749].

* Route binding behavior for a request argument with a generic type has changed. For routes that take in an `HttpRequest<SomeType>`, an `UnsatisfiedRouteException` will be thrown if no body is found in the request. To restore the previous behavior, remove the generic type from the argument.

    public String hello(HttpRequest<Author> request) //requires the body to be present

    public String hello(HttpRequest request) //the body will not be read (same as 1.0.x)
