Key features:

- https://www.graalvm.org/release-notes/22_3/[GraalVM 22.3 Support]
- With Micronaut `3.8.0`, you can use `@RequestBean` annotations with https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/language/records.html[Records]. Before `3.8.0`, you could use a POJO as a controller method parameter and annotate the parameter with `@RequestBean` to bind any Bindable value (e.g., `HttpRequest`, `@PathVariable`, `@QueryValue` or `@Header` fields).
- If you enable CORS from any origin while running your app in localhost (e.g., test or development), since `3.8.0`, the `CorsFilter` returns 403 for non-localhost origins to protect you against drive-by localhost attacks.
