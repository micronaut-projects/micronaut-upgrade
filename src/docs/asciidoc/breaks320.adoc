=== 3.2.0 Breaking Changes

- The HTTP client now does SSL certificate verification by default. The old insecure behavior can be re-enabled by setting the `micronaut.http.client.ssl.insecureTrustAllCertificates` property to `true`, but consider using a trust store instead if you're using self-signed certificates.

- Maven GraalVM Native Image plugin has new GAV coordinates. If you have declared it in your `pom.xml` please update the coordinates to:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
    <artifactId>native-maven-plugin</artifactId>
...
</plugin>
----

- `WebSocketClient.create` has been modified to accept a `URI` parameter instead of `URL`. The old `URL` methods still exist, but when called with `null` like `WebSocketClient.create(null)`, the method call is now ambiguous. Please insert a cast to `URI`: `WebSocketClient.create((URI) null)`.
The same applies for the `create` method that accepts an additional `HttpClientConfiguration` parameter.
